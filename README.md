# XdTwitchBot
This is a console-based twitch.tv bot that whispers naughty users who type "Xd" in chat. Capitalization does matter. Xd is bad, use XD, xd, xD, XDDDDD etc. instead.
Built with TwitchLib:
https://github.com/TwitchLib/TwitchLib

## Usage
You're gonna need a .resx file with the desired Channel Name, Bot Username, Bot Token and Bot's Client Id. I'm not going to show you how to get them, but just input them into the file and run it.
This is a meme project btw. Don't ask any questions.
